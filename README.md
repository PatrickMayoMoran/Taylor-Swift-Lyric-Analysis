# Taylor-Swift-Lyric-Analysis

### Getting and cleaning lyrics from all Taylor Swift studio albums and analyzing them for repetitiveness.  
This was my final project for the free CodeInPlace class offered during COVID-19.  
The code consists of two parts - scraping the lyrics from online and writing them to text files and doing basic analysis.  
The analysis as of 5/30/2020 consists of looking at percentage of unique words per song as a proxy for repetitiveness.  
This project was completed after 60 hours of learning to code with an additional 12 hours devoted to the project.  
It is my first real program!
